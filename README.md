The MultiCategorical class is designed to represent a collection of independent Categorical distributions.

__init__: The constructor takes a list of Categorical distributions as input and stores them.
log_prob: This method calculates the logarithm of the probability density for a given value. It iterates through the individual Categorical distributions and the corresponding parts of the input value, calculates the log probability for each, stacks them, and then sums across the distributions.
entropy: This method calculates the entropy of the distribution by summing the entropies of the individual Categorical distributions.
sample: This method generates samples from the distribution by sampling from each individual Categorical distribution and stacking the results.
The multi_categorical_maker function is a factory function that creates a function to construct a MultiCategorical distribution.

It takes nvec as input, which is a list of integers representing the number of categories for each individual Categorical distribution within the MultiCategorical.
It returns a function get_multi_categorical that takes a tensor of logits as input. This function then splits the logits according to the nvec to create a list of Categorical distributions and finally returns a MultiCategorical instance.# Multi_Categorical_Distributions2


 MultiCategorical distribution, as have been implemented , can be represented as a product of independent Categorical distributions. The torch.distributions library provides the fundamental building blocks like Categorical, and users can combine these basic distributions to create more complex ones like your MultiCategorical.

This approach offers flexibility, allowing users to define various composite distributions based on their specific needs, rather than torch  providing every possible combination of basic distributions.  MultiCategorical class is a good example of how you can build upon the existing Categorical distribution in torch.distributions to create a distribution that suits your requirements.


# Example usage in Colab

import torch

# Suppose we have 2 categorical distributions, each with 3 and 2 classes
nvec = [3, 2]
multi_categorical_fn = multi_categorical_maker(nvec)

# Random logits for a batch size of 1
logits = torch.randn(1, sum(nvec))

# Create distribution
mcd = multi_categorical_fn(logits)

# Sample
sample = mcd.sample()
print("Sample:", sample)

# Log probability
log_prob = mcd.log_prob(sample)
print("Log probability:", log_prob)
